abstract: With the continuous popularization of smartphones and their ever-evolving
  photographic capabilities, individuals can easily take a large number of photos
  in their daily lives, creating a natural impetus for image editing. With the ability
  of style-based GAN, images can be reasonably edited on specific semantics by manipulating
  in latent space of the generator, particularly for human facial photographs. However,
  such methods are heavily rely on the datasets with diverse data and rich semantic
  annotations at the same time. Unfortunately, there is no such dataset for outdoor
  scenes with diverse and complex structural content, which makes current editing
  methods almost ineffective. To overcome these challenges, we first construct an
  extensive synthetic outdoor scene dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations
  based on an automated process. Based on it, we propose an editing network dedicated
  to multi-class annotations that can efficiently edit specific attributes while preserving
  others as much as possible. Extensive experiments evince that our method achieves
  better performance in outdoor scene editing, especially in regards to distance and
  viewpoint across several outdoor scene datasets.
