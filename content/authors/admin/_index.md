Welcome! I am Zongwei Liu(刘宗炜), a senior student at SJTU, majoring in Measurement and Instrumentation. Now I am going to start a new life as a graduate. The research filed is about GNSS-RTK position, which I never learned before. Still I keep a passion for programming and development, I hope my major do not influence it.
